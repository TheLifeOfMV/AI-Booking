1  Purpose & Scope
Build a multi‑channel booking system that lets patients reserve appointments with licensed doctors through phone call, WhatsApp, or an in‑app flow.
Key constraints: no payment collection in MVP, Spanish‑only AI assistant, embeddable widget + open API for partner sites, and admin tools for global oversight.

2  Personas & Roles
Persona / Role	Primary Goals	Key Capabilities
Patient	• Find the right specialist • Book quickly • Receive reminders	• Multi‑channel booking • View upcoming / past visits • Cancel / reschedule
Doctor	• Keep calendar full • Manage availability • Review patient list	• Maintain profile & slots • View bookings • Mark consultation as done
Clinic Assistant	• Manage multiple doctors’ calendars	• Edit slots on doctors’ behalf • Confirm attendance
Super‑Admin	• Governance, data integrity, analytics	• CRUD any record • Impersonate any user • Access audit logs
AI WhatsApp/Voice Agent	• Handle natural‑language booking tasks	• Conversational slot search • Create bookings • Send reminders

3  User Journey (Happy Path)
App Launch & Intro

Splash screen with brand + “Get Started”.

On first run, an interactive intro (3 slides) explains the three booking options.

Channel Selection

Screen presents: “Phone Call” | “WhatsApp” | “In App”.

If Phone Call → user enters number → AI agent calls, gathers intent, books, and sends confirmation via WhatsApp + e‑mail.

If WhatsApp → deep‑link opens chat with pre‑filled “Start” message → AI agent continues flow.

If In App → proceed to step 3.

Dashboard (In‑App Flow)

Specialties carousel (Dentist, Cardiologist, etc.) – horizontally scrollable cards with icons/photos.

User taps a specialty → calendar strip for the next 14 days appears.

After picking a date, a doctor list grid shows profile card + rating + years experience.

Selecting a doctor opens a time‑slot picker (20‑/40‑/60‑min blocks).

“Confirm” → booking stored; success screen shows details + add‑to‑calendar button.

Post‑Booking Lifecycle

Reminders at T‑24 h and T‑1 h (WhatsApp + e‑mail).

After consultation, T + 2 h feedback survey.

Patient can cancel/reschedule inside app up to 24 h ahead without penalty (no payments taken).

Real‑time analytics dashboard (bookings/day, utilisation, channel split).

System audit log export.

4.6 Open API
Public endpoints: GET /specialties, GET /slots, POST /bookings, PATCH /bookings/{id}, DELETE /bookings/{id}.

Webhooks: booking.created, booking.updated, booking.cancelled.

Auth: OAuth 2 client‑credentials or API token.

Rate limit baseline 120 req/min.

5  Non‑Functional Requirements
Category	Target
Performance	≤ 200 ms median API latency; ≤ 1 s FMP on 3G mobile
Scalability	5 k MAU, 200 concurrent bookings peak
Availability	99.9 % monthly uptime
Security	AES‑256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit; 2FA for doctors & admins
Compliance	Habeas Data (Colombia), GDPR‑aligned; HIPAA‑friendly design
Accessibility	WCAG 2.1 AA for web & mobile views
Budget	Cloud spend ≤ USD 1 k/mo for MVP

6  Roadmap & Milestones (value‑ordered)
Phase	Scope	Target Month
MVP	Core in‑app booking + WhatsApp/Voice agent + admin dashboard + API	M 3
Widget GA	2‑line embed code for partner sites + public docs	M 4
Multi‑clinic mode	Tenancy, assistant role, aggregated analytics	M 5
Video Consultations	Secure video links & virtual waiting room	M 6
Multi‑language AI	Add English & Portuguese NLP models	M 7

7  Acceptance Criteria (MVP)
A first‑time patient can complete an in‑app booking in ≤ 60 s.

AI agent (WhatsApp) books a slot with ≥ 95 % success on first turn.

Doctors can add, edit, and delete slots; changes propagate in < 5 s.

Admin can impersonate any user and edit a booking.

API returns correct slot data and emits webhooks for all create/update/cancel events.

Median end‑to‑end transaction (API) latency ≤ 200 ms under 200 concurrent users.

Pen‑test yields no critical vulnerabilities (OWASP Top‑10).

8  Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Impact	Mitigation
AI misunderstanding patient intent	Mis‑bookings, poor UX	Confirmation step + quick edit link; continuous NLP tuning
Doctor no‑shows (no payment penalty)	Patient churn	Automated reminders to doctors; flag low‑reliability profiles
Data‑privacy breach	Legal penalties	Encryption, role‑based access, annual audits
Low adoption by doctors	Empty inventory	Early partnership program with clinics; bulk onboarding tools
Scalability bottlenecks	Downtime	Horizontal‑scale architecture, load tests before launch
