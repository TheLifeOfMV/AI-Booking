# Virtual Consultation Feature Removal Summary
# Following MONOCODE principles: Observable Implementation & Progressive Construction

## Overview
Systematically removed virtual consultation features ("Ofrecer consultas virtuales") from the AI Booking application as requested by the user.

## Files Modified

### Core Type Definitions
- `ai-doctor-booking/src/types/doctor.ts`
  - Removed: `isVirtual: boolean` property from Doctor interface

### Doctor Components
- `ai-doctor-booking/src/app/doctor/profile/page.tsx`
  - Removed: `isVirtual` property from DoctorProfile interface
  - Removed: Virtual consultation checkbox in profile form
  - Removed: `isVirtual: true` from MOCK_DOCTOR_PROFILE

- `ai-doctor-booking/src/app/doctor/dashboard/page.tsx`
  - Removed: `isVirtual` properties from MOCK_APPOINTMENTS
  - Updated: Appointment display to always show "Presencial" instead of dynamic virtual/in-person

### Admin Components
- `ai-doctor-booking/src/components/admin/Doctors/steps/AvailabilityStep.tsx`
  - Removed: "Offers Virtual Consultations" checkbox
  - Cleaned: Form layout after removal

### Patient Components
- `ai-doctor-booking/src/components/patient/AppointmentCard.tsx`
  - Removed: `isVirtual` property from interface
  - Removed: FiVideo icon import
  - Updated: Always show FiMapPin icon for location
  - Simplified: Location display logic

- `ai-doctor-booking/src/app/patient/profile/page.tsx`
  - Removed: `isVirtual` property usage in AppointmentCard components

### Service Layer
- `ai-doctor-booking/src/services/doctorService.ts`
  - Removed: `isVirtual` properties from all MOCK_DOCTORS entries

- `ai-doctor-booking/src/services/patientService.ts`
  - Removed: `isVirtual` properties from appointment mock data
  - Updated: "Consulta Online" location changed to "Hospital Dermatológico, Sala 2"

## Implementation Strategy
1. **Progressive Construction**: Removed features systematically from types → components → services
2. **Observable Implementation**: Each change was atomic and verifiable
3. **Error Prevention**: Used search-replace for exact matches to avoid breaking related code
4. **Consistency**: All virtual consultation references removed uniformly across the codebase

## Verification
- ✅ No remaining `isVirtual` properties in codebase
- ✅ No remaining "virtuales" text in Spanish
- ✅ All appointment cards now show physical location icons
- ✅ All forms cleaned of virtual consultation options
- ✅ Mock data updated to reflect physical-only appointments

## Note
The channel page still contains "asistente virtual" which refers to the AI chat assistant, not medical consultations, so it was left unchanged.
